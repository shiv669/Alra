/**
 * ALRA Content Script
 *
 * This script runs on EVERY webpage the user visits
 * It's responsible for:
 * - Optimizing the page layout (removing ads, cleaning clutter)
 * - Showing UI elements like nudges, summaries, predictions
 * - Collecting metrics (time spent, user interactions)
 * - Communicating with the background script
 *
 * Think of this as the "eyes and hands" of ALRA on each webpage
 * The background script is the "brain" that makes decisions
